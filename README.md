- 👋 Hello, I’m @CharlesAFagan
- 👀 After working nearly twenty years as an Avionics technician I decided to pursue a new path in software development. I recently finished getting a BS in software engineering and have learned a lot about software development along the way, including my favorite part, coding. One thing that I have found to be the most compelling to me when it comes to writing software is the problem solving aspect. When it comes to this I rarely leave it at well enough but instead continue on to find more efficient and effective ways to do things. While I have only coded in Java thus far, I am sure that I could pick up any language very quickly and I look forward to the challenges that lie ahead. Other than my newfound passion for writing software I also enjoy many outdoor activites to include Snowboarding, rock climbing and even just a beautiful hike through the mountains.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub so that I can share some of my personal work with the world as well as find projects that I would be interested in contributing to. I would like to give back to a community that has provided me and many others with a lot of good software. 
- 💞️ As I learn more about software coding and GitHub I would like to collaborate on projects that are primarily written in Java to begin with. As I become more comfortable with my capabilities I will surely take on the challenge of new languages to broaden my capabilities.
